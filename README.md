**Build, run, and monitor data pipelines at scale**

Instructors:

* [Kalise Richmond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliserichmond/) - Sales Engineer, Prefect
* [Nathan Nowack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-nowack-a6b59b143/) - Solutions Engineer, Prefect

About:

Data engineers and scientists spend most of their time on negative or defensive engineering, writing code to handle unpredictable failures such as resources going down, APIs intermittently failing, or malformed data corrupting data pipelines. Workflow orchestration tools help eliminate negative engineering, allowing engineers and scientists to focus on the problems they are solving. Modern data applications have evolved, and orchestrators such as Prefect are providing more runtime flexibility and the ability to leverage distributed compute through Dask.

Discover how workflow orchestration can free you up to build solutions, not just avert failures. Youâ€™ll learn about basic orchestration features such as retries, scheduling, parameterization, caching, and secret management, and youâ€™ll construct real data pipelines.

## Let's get our development environment set up! ðŸš€

For this course you will need:

**Python**

Python greater than version 3.6 is required. Version 3.6 is reaching end of life soon.

* Packages in the `requirements.txt` file
    * prefect==2.0b2 - workflow orchestration
    * beautifulsoup4 - web scraping
    * jupyter        - interactive notebooks

Ideally, you can create a virtual environment (conda, pipenv, poetry) to install the dependencies.

To install the requirements with pip:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Docker**

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a great entrypoint (pun somewhat intended) into world of engineering! We'll be using it to provide reproducible environments to execute our workflows in.

- [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


**Optional**

For the advanced section of this course, we will use a couple of common data engineering tools:
- your own [Airbyte](https://docs.airbyte.com/#quick-start) instance
- [Snowflake trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com)
- install [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) to run transforms on your warehouse objects
