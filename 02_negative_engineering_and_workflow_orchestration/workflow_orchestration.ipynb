    "# Workflow Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow orchestration frameworks are primarily used to monitor and observe the movement of data in production applications. Such frameworks typically include a family of independent features that collectively make modern data pipelines fault-tolerant and robust. These features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* scheduling and triggering jobs\n",
    "* retrying failed work\n",
    "* dependency and state management\n",
    "* caching expensive tasks\n",
    "* resource management\n",
    "* observability\n",
    "\n",
    "These allow us to gracefully handle failure events, including scenarios beyond our control like cloud outages or API failures. Without explicitly tracking states in data pipelines, they become prone to triggering premature jobs, re-running already completed work, or even failing haphazardly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features workflow orchestration provides are not limited to supporting the scheduled movement of data from a source to a destination. These features are also heavily applied in other domains such as machine learning and parameterized report generation. Presently, workflow orchestration is getting simple enough for hobbyists to adopt for personal projects. \n"
